### üöÄ About Me  
I'm passionate about building **intelligent, scalable systems** that bridge software engineering and machine learning.  
Currently, I‚Äôm exploring the intersection of **AI, distributed systems, and financial technology**‚Äîfrom designing microservices for trading platforms to developing travel recommender systems and sports analysis tools.  

---

### üß† Current Focus  
- **Distributed Microservices Architecture** with Spring Boot, Spring Cloud & Kafka  
- **AI for Sports & Mobility Analytics** (ML + Geospatial + Computer Vision)  
- **Full-Stack Product Development** using React, Flask, and Next.js  
- **Cloud Deployments & CI/CD** with Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, and AWS

### üíº Experience

#### **Coding Mind Academy** ‚Äî *Program Developer* (Aug 2023 ‚Äì Present)  
- Developed RESTful backend services in **Java + Spring Boot + MySQL** for the CM Base learning platform.  
- Improved student project completion rates by **40%** through engaging programming lessons using Scratch, Minecraft Education, and Python.  
- Collaborated in **Agile/SCRUM** teams to deliver new course content and digital learning features.

#### **SoftCom Lab, Cal Poly Pomona** ‚Äî *Research Intern* (Mar 2023 ‚Äì Aug 2024)  
- Applied **machine learning** to optimize **MediaPipe** for golf-swing pose estimation, boosting precision by 15%.  
- Developed **GolfBud1**, an AI-powered mobile golf analyzer with 5,000+ downloads; integrated **Flutter + Flask + AWS EC2 + Firebase** stack.  
- Co-authored and presented a peer-reviewed paper at **CMCA 2023** on AI in sports technology.

### üß© Featured Projects

#### üè¶ **Trading Capture System** *(May 2025 ‚Äì Present)*  
A scalable, distributed trade capture and validation system designed for investment bank middle-office operations.  
- Architected microservices with **Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Kafka, and QuickFIX/J** for **real-time FIX message ingestion** and validation.  
- Implemented **Spring Data JPA** and **Hibernate** for trade persistence and audit tracking.  
- Developed **event-driven workflows** using **Kafka topics** to asynchronously handle corrections, cancellations, and enrichment events.  
- Integrated **Spring Security + OAuth 2.0** for secure API authentication and role-based access control.  
- Deployed containerized services with **Docker, Kubernetes**, and automated CI/CD via **Jenkins pipelines**.  
- Built a **React + Next.js + Redux dashboard** for real-time execution visualization, latency metrics, and trade lifecycle tracking.  
- Achieved full fault tolerance, horizontal scalability, and dynamic resource allocation across environments.

#### üåç **Travel Tracker** *(Apr 2025 ‚Äì Present)*  
A full-stack web app that enables users to securely log in, record trips, and visualize travel history through dynamic, interactive maps.  
- Designed and implemented **Flask-based REST APIs** for travel logs, user profiles, and authentication (using **Flask-Login** and **Bcrypt**).  
- Built a **PostgreSQL**-backed **SQLAlchemy** ORM schema with optimized indexing for large user datasets.  
- Integrated **Leaflet.js + OpenStreetMap APIs** for real-time map rendering, trip clustering, and region-based visualization.  
- Developed a **Travel Recommendation Engine** leveraging collaborative filtering, content-based embeddings, and **geospatial clustering (KMeans + cosine similarity)**.  
- Deployed the recommender as a **Flask microservice** with `/recommend` endpoints responding in <200ms latency.  
- Designed responsive UI and analytics dashboards for trip statistics, heatmaps, and personal insights.

#### üèåÔ∏è **GolfBud1** *(Mar 2023 ‚Äì Aug 2024)*  
An intelligent golf swing analyzer that leverages AI and pose estimation to provide real-time feedback to users.  
- Integrated **MediaPipe Pose**, **OpenCV**, and custom **SVM/Decision Tree** classifiers to improve swing form detection accuracy by 15%.  
- Built a **Flask backend API** for motion data processing and linked it to a **Flutter mobile frontend**.  
- Hosted backend inference services on **AWS EC2**, with real-time video storage on **Firebase**.  
- Used **threshold-based keypoint tracking** and **multi-angle detection** to achieve multi-view precision.  
- Gained over **5,000 downloads** on app stores; secured a **provisional patent** for the motion feedback algorithm.  
- Research published and presented at **CMCA 2023** on AI-driven sports analytics.

#### üßÆ **Apex Cluster** *(2022 ‚Äì 2023)*  
A high school capstone project using clustering algorithms to **optimally group students** based on their interests for a presentation event.  
- Designed and implemented a **K-means + preference weighting algorithm** to classify over **300+ students** into sessions aligned with their top interests.  
- Built data pipelines in **Python (NumPy + pandas)** for processing survey responses and converting them into normalized vector representations.  
- Integrated an **iterative optimization** layer to minimize overlap between conflicting interest groups and maximize satisfaction scores.  
- üìä **Visualized cluster distribution and satisfaction rates using Matplotlib + Seaborn dashboards.**  
- Used by the **school‚Äôs administration team** to schedule viewing sessions ‚Äî improving student preference match rate by **35%** compared to random assignment.  
- Sparked further interest in applied machine learning for event optimization and education analytics.
